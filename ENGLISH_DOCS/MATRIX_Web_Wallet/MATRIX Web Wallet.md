## Make Deposits (Under 'Deposit/Withdrawal' of Online Wallet)


In order to be a candidate of MATRIX miners or validators, you must first make the required deposits, which can be accomplished via our online wallet.


There are two types of deposit transactions: deposit for miners (deposit should be between 10,000 and 100,000 MANs) and deposit for validators (deposit should be equal to or greater than 100,000 MANs).


### Deposits for Miners

The remaining steps are similar to those of 'Deposits for Miners' except that the Deposit Amount should be >= 100,000 MANs.
