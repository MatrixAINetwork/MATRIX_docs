## Developement Tools
### Developer Smart Contracts
#### Smart Contract Languages
+ Solidity- EVM smart contracting language
+ Bamboo - A morphing smart contract language

#### Frameworks
+ Truffle - Most popular smart contract development, testing, and deployment framework. The Truffle suite includes Truffle, and Drizzle and Ganache
+ Dapp - Framework for DApp development, successor to DApple
#### IDEs
+ Remix - Web IDE with built in static analysis, test blockchain VM.

+ Pragma - Very simple web IDE for solidity, and auto-generated interfaces for smart contracts. autocomplete-solidity, and language-solidity packages

+ Visual Studio Code - Visual Studio Code extension that adds support for Solidity
+ Intellij Solidity Plugin - Open-source plug-in for JetBrains IntelliJ Idea IDE (free/commercial) with syntax highlighting, formatting, code completion etc.

## Smart Contracts
### Smart Contracts Overview
Smart contracts are autonomous agents deployed on a blockchain which will execute code and actions depending on given conditions.

### Usecases for smart contracts
Function as ‘multi-signature’ accounts, so that funds are spent only when a required percentage of people agree
Manage agreements between users, say, if one buys insurance from the other

Provide utility to other contracts (similar to how a software library works)

Store information about an application, such as domain registration information or membership records.
Solidity language

Solidity is a high-level programming language, that is used to implement smart contracts on MATRIX MAINNET.

It has Python, C++ and JavaScript influences and is used for Ethereum Virtual Machine ( EVM ). As a result, it is fairly convenient and easy to grasp for those that are already familiar with the Python, C++ or JavaScript.
