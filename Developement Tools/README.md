## Developement Tools
### Developer Smart Contracts
#### Smart Contract Languages
+ [Solidity](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)- EVM smart contracting language


#### Frameworks
+ [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/) - Most popular smart contract development, testing, and deployment framework. The Truffle suite includes Truffle, and Drizzle and Ganache
+ [Dapp](https://dapp.tools/dapp/) - Framework for DApp development, successor to DApple
#### IDEs
+ [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=false) - Web IDE with built in static analysis, test blockchain VM.

+ [Pragma](https://www.withpragma.com/) - Very simple web IDE for solidity, and auto-generated interfaces for smart contracts. autocomplete-solidity, and language-solidity packages

+ [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity) - Visual Studio Code extension that adds support for Solidity


### Transaction APIs

+ [Address format](https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/TxSend-Sign-Demos/blob/master/Address%20Format.md)
+ [js SDK for transactions](https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/TxSend-Sign-Demos/tree/master/js)
+ [Golang SDK for transactions](https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/TxSend-Sign-Demos/tree/master/go)
+ [Java SDK for transactions](https://github.com/MatrixAINetwork/TxSend-Sign-Demos/tree/master/java)

## Smart Contracts
### Smart Contracts Overview
Smart contracts are autonomous agents deployed on a blockchain which will execute code and actions depending on given conditions.

### Usecases for smart contracts
Function as ‘multi-signature’ accounts, so that funds are spent only when a required percentage of people agree
Manage agreements between users, say, if one buys insurance from the other

Provide utility to other contracts (similar to how a software library works)

Store information about an application, such as domain registration information or membership records.
Solidity language

Solidity is a high-level programming language, that is used to implement smart contracts on MATRIX MAINNET.

It has Python, C++ and JavaScript influences and is used for Ethereum Virtual Machine ( EVM ). As a result, it is fairly convenient and easy to grasp for those that are already familiar with the Python, C++ or JavaScript.
